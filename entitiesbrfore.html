		"it is not critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arean , ehose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;
	who strive valiantly; who errs,who comes short again and again ,beacuse there is no efforts wuthout error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds ; who knows graet devotions; who spends "himself in worhty cause; who is the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievment ,and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory &nbsp;nor &nbsp;defeat".
